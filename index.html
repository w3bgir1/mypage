                <p>Hello, my name is Oleksandra, but my friends call me Sasha.</p>
                <p>I was always fascinated by computers and everything related to them. I mastered the Internet very early and I always wondered how it works. My dad was also interested in these questions and that's how a javascript book appeared in our house. It helped me to build my first homepage, then my friend asked me to make a page for her, then relatives, neighbors and acquaintances. This was my first freelance job.</p>
                <p>After graduating from school, I entered the university to 'Media systems programming and computer design' speciality. I studied there for 2 years, then I became a mother and it was impossible to combine my studies and motherhood.</p>
                <p>Over the past 10 years we switched countries 5 times, travelled a lot and I had different jobs and hobbies. 
                Last summer we moved to Netherlands and I finally felt that this is the place where I want to live. But still, I had some sort of existential crisis, this feeling that I'm missing something important bothered me. And than I realized, it's coding that I'm missing.</p>
                <p>Now it's time to make my childhood dream come true.</p>
